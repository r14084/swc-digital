title: Building from source
description: Build any of the three board targets with PlatformIO, and the ESP32 toolchain notes.
---

The three board targets share one codebase and build from [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). Pick the env that matches your board.

```bash
pio run -e smalltv                 # ESP8266
pio run -e smalltv_c2              # ESP32-C2
pio run -e smalltv_esp32           # NM-TV-154 (classic ESP32)
pio run -e smalltv_c2 -t upload    # build + flash the C2 over USB-C
pio device monitor -e smalltv_c2   # serial logs @ 115200
pio run -e smalltv_loader          # ESP8266 loader for the SmallTV-ultra
```

## The smalltv_loader env

`smalltv_loader` (source `src/loader.cpp`) builds a minimal ESP8266 image: WiFi plus a web OTA endpoint at `/update`, nothing else. Its only job is the two-step [SmallTV-ultra install](/smalltv-mod/getting-started/flashing/#smalltv-ultra-stock-updater-says-not-enough-space), where the stock Ultra layout rejects the full image. The loader is small enough to fit that stock slot, and it uses this firmware's own 4m1m flash layout (`eagle.flash.4m1m.ld`), so its own `/update` slot is large enough to then accept the full `smalltv-mod-firmware.bin`.

```bash
pio run -e smalltv_loader
```

By default the loader opens an open access point named `SmallTV-Loader` at `192.168.4.1`. To have it auto-join an existing network instead, bake the credentials in at build time by adding the two flags to the env's `build_flags` (or via `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS`):

```
-DLOADER_SSID='"MyNet"' -DLOADER_PASS='"secret"'
```

Credentials are compile-time only and never live in the repo. The build output is published as the release asset `smalltv-mod-loader.bin`.

## How one codebase builds for all three

Chip differences are centralized so the feature code stays the same on every board.

- `src/Platform.h` holds every chip-specific include, class alias, and small shim. The WiFi stack, web server, HTTPS client, OTA, and reset handling all resolve through it. Both ESP32 targets share its Arduino core 3.x branch.
- `src/board_esp8266.h`, `src/board_esp32c2.h`, and `src/board_esp32.h` hold the pin map and panel quirks for each board. `src/config.h` includes the right one based on the build target.
- The three feature modes, the web UI, and the settings layer are identical across all targets.

The target is chosen by a build flag: `SMALLTV_ESP8266`, `SMALLTV_ESP32C2`, or `SMALLTV_ESP32`.

## ESP32 toolchain notes

The two ESP32 targets have a few requirements the ESP8266 does not.

- **Platform**: PlatformIO's official espressif32 does not support the C2 and is stuck on Arduino core 2.x. Both ESP32 envs use the [pioarduino](https://github.com/pioarduino/platform-espressif32) fork, which tracks Arduino core 3.x on ESP-IDF 5.x (`Platform.h`'s ESP32 branch needs core 3.x). The first build downloads a large toolchain and compiles the IDF from source, so it takes several minutes. Later builds are fast.
- **Display driver**: both use `Arduino_HWSPI` with explicit pins. The register-level `Arduino_ESP32SPI` hangs on the C2, and the software-SPI path in the library does not cover it. `Arduino_HWSPI` uses the stock SPI driver and works.
- **Flashing the C2**: uploads call the system esptool, not the one bundled with PlatformIO, which hangs entering download mode on that board. Install it with `pip install esptool`. The classic ESP32 flashes with either.
- **Partitions**: the 4 MB layout in `partitions/smalltv_4mb_ota.csv` gives two OTA app slots plus about 0.9 MB for LittleFS, and is shared by both ESP32 targets.

## Footprint

The ESP8266 build is about 620 KB of flash and roughly half the RAM at boot, with headroom for OTA, which needs room for two sketch copies. The ESP32-C2 build is about 1.27 MB in a 1.5 MB app slot, using around 15 percent of RAM. The mascot frame data lives in flash, not the heap.

The PC-side usage daemon is a separate repo: [clawdmeter-daemon](https://github.com/giovi321/clawdmeter-daemon).
